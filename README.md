## ðŸ’¾ - VisualTexture v2
VisualTexture is a Multi-tool which i created a couple of years ago, which has the purpose of displaying some information about sa-mp, basically it is a kind of Wiki in Software version.

This tool allows you to `generate hexcolor's`, `view samp textures`, `animations`, `sprites` and later possibly a couple of other things. The animations section has an instance which is connected to the web platform to view these animations, since for the moment the idea is to try to reproduce animations within the software itself, but so far it is just an idea.
